      <content><![CDATA[<p>Typically images are organized in galleries, that offer a thumbnail collection to the content manager in order to keep the selection as simple as possible.Â OpenCms from version 6 features integrated image scaling and resizing. This way it's easy to manipulate commonly used image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, TIF etc. to make sure the output in a template is always of the required size, to generate thumbnails in overview lists and more. Additional image processing filters like "add drop shadow to image" are also available.</p>]]></content>
