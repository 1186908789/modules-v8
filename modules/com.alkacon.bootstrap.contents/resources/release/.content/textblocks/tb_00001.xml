<h2>Who should use this OpenCms 9 RC distribution download?</h2>
<p>It is recommended for heavy OpenCms users, developers and contributors to install and try out this release candidate version, in order to prepare for the upcoming OpenCms 9 final release.</p>
<p>Users looking for a stable installation should use the latest 8.5.2 version now and upgrade to OpenCms 9 when the final release is available. Please note that there will be no update wizard provided for any release candidate (RC) version to the final release of OpenCms 9.</p>
<h2>Backward compatibility</h2>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">OpenCms 9.0 RC is fully backward compatible to all prior 8.x and 7.x versions. Templates and other OpenCms developed code from these versions should work "out of the box" with version 9.0 RC.</span></p>
<p><strong>Notice for users of Alkacon OCEE:</strong> This release candidate does not work with current Alkacon OCEE versions, please wait for the final OpenCms 9 release.</p>
<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 9.0 RC has been written and tested for Java 6 and 7. We have tested only with ORACLEs version of the JDK. OpenCms should run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms works "out of the box" with Tomcat 7, which we recommend. Others have reported deploying OpenCms successfully on other servlet containers like JBoss, BEA, Websphere, Glassfish and Resin Professional.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, DB2 and HSQLDB.</p>
<h2>Regarding version numbers and build tags</h2>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from Git, please keep the following in mind: The tag numbers for all OpenCms 9.0 final releases will be "build_9_0_x". The 9.0 RC release is tagged "build_8_9_0".</p>
<p>The main OpenCms Git repository is available on Github at <a href="%(link0)">github.com/alkacon/opencms-core</a>.</p>
